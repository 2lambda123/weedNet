# Multispectral dataset 
Please head to [dataset](https://github.com/inkyusa/weedNet/tree/master/data/Sequoia) for the multispectral images (NIR, Red, and NDVI with their labels).


***
Due to several requests for raw multi-spectral images (4ch), we unofficially made this available [raw dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1moUzw39CEp3kXBzRfFcHEOEi4D4WRmZM) (1.8GB) and you can checkout [this branch](https://github.com/inkyusa/weedNet/tree/rgb-samples) for sample RGB images. Please note that these datasets do not have the corresponding labels and we couldn't guarantee the maintenance of them due to limited resources. Thank you for your understandings and hope this helps.

### Training weedNet
If you want to know more about how to train a network (using a caffe framework) with this dataset, here we have [an experimental repo](https://github.com/inkyusa/weedNet-devel) that allows you to do this (courtesy by Marija Popovic).

### Annotated ground truth images
The annotated ground truth images for training and testing are indexed images meaning that they were filled with class IDs rather than RGB values. For example, the background is 0, crop is 1, and weed is 2. You can directly use these indexed files for model training using Caffe SegNet (or other networks) without any data conversions.  If you want to visualize these files (e.g., https://github.com/inkyusa/weedNet/blob/master/data/Sequoia/SequoiaRed_30/testannot/0000.png) the following MATLAB code snippet may help;
```
im=imread('./0000.png');
plantColor=[0 1 0]; %green
weedColor=[1 0 0]; %red
map=[plantColor;weedColor];
rgb=label2rgb(im,map,[0,0,0]); %label img, map, bg color
imshow(rgb);
```
